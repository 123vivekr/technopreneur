To successfully emerge from the ashes of the dire conditions of a pandemic stricken world, this year's theme for Technopreneur is to evolve into a better world through disruption, to provide the most innovative solutions for our problems. Our theme hopes to invoke a sense of responsibility and leadership in one's mind in order for them to understand that all our battles can be won through entrepreneurial solutions.
